# Zip Speech
A text to speech tool for Google Meet - Giving a voice to those who don't have one

Zip Speech is an accessibility tool designed to give a voice to those who cannot speak during Google Meet calls.

Unlike other text-to-speech tools that play audio out of your computer speakers (causing echo), Zip Speech injects the audio directly into your Google Meet microphone stream. This means other participants hear you clearly, as if you were speaking yourself, while you can still hear the meeting audio perfectly.

**Key Features:**
* **Direct Audio Injection:** Crystal clear audio sent directly to the meeting, eliminating feedback loops.
* **Floating Interface:** A clean, movable panel that stays inside your meeting tab so you never lose focus.
* **Multiple Accents:** Choose from American, British, Australian, and Indian English accents.
* **Multilingual Support:** Speak in French, Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, and Chinese.
* **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Press Ctrl+Enter to speak instantly.
* **Privacy First:** No data is stored or sent to third-party servers beyond the text-to-speech engine.

**Who is this for?**
* Individuals with speech impairments or disabilities.
* Users in noisy environments who need to type to communicate.
* Anyone who prefers typing but wants to be heard audibly in a meeting.

**How to use:**
1.  Install the extension.
2.  Join a Google Meet call.
3.  The Zip Speech panel will appear automatically.
4.  Type your message and click "Speak" (or press Ctrl+Enter).

Note: You must refresh your Google Meet tab once after installing for the audio engine to load.
